This article outlines trends in popular music during the 2020s, primarily in The United States and English-speaking countries. The early years of the decade presented challenges for the music industry, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread concert cancellations due to health concerns. By mid-2023, the industry recorded its highest annual revenue to date ($8.4 billion), partly due to the growth of streaming subscriptions. Key artists in the 2020s included Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa, Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Bruno Mars, Morgan Wallen, Kendrick Lamar, Olivia Rodrigo, The Weeknd, Megan Thee Stallion, Sabrina Carpenter, SZA, BTS, Blackpink, Chappell Roan, Charli XCX, Harry Styles, Bad Bunny, Travis Scott, Doja Cat, Playboi Carti, and Tyler The Creator.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the cancellation or postponement of numerous music-related events scheduled to take place in the early 2020s, including major tours, festivals, and television appearances. Due to the restrictions, many artists conducted virtual experiences as an alternative to live events (e.g. Dua Lipa's Studio 2054 and Taylor Swift's Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions).[1] The COVID-19 pandemic has also resorted artists to postponements or rescheduling of major tours to at least a year or two from their initially scheduled tour dates, examples including The Stadium Tour (co-headlined by Mötley Crüe and Def Leppard), Ozzy Osbourne's headlining tour No More Tours II and Rage Against the Machine's reunion tour.[2][3][4] 2020s also marked the massive rise of genreless music and fragmentation of music thanks to COVID-19 lockdowns for isolation and loneliness, and the use of internet, streaming media, TikTok with its algorithm, playlists and unlimited access. Katy Perry's concert residency, Play happened during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

TikTok emerged as a key musical tastemaker for Generation Z during their adolescence and Generation Alpha in their early childhood, shaping their music tastes through viral songs and trends. Similar to short-form video platforms of the 2010s like Vine, TikTok's interactive content—such as comedy skits, fan edits, memes, dance routines, and makeup tutorials—helped songs gain popularity as users incorporated them into their videos. While viral success on TikTok didn't always translate to lasting success on the Billboard Hot 100, it had a unique ability to pull relatively unknown artists out of obscurity. These artists built impressive fanbases and often attracted attention from major labels, leading to opportunities to sign record deals. TikTok's focus on music, niche communities and pop culture fandoms allowed these artists to thrive within specific subcultures and subgenres.

Strategic collaborations with popular TikTok creators, sponsored hashtag challenges, and the use of licensed music in viral videos became integral components of contemporary music marketing strategies. The TikTok Billboard chart was created in September 2023 to meet the demand for viral audios from the platform.[5][6][7][8][9][10]

In 2020, LP records surpassed compact disc (CD) sales for the first time since 1986, LP records 28.7% ($619.6 million) with the rapid decline in CD sales by 23% ($483 million), with 62% ($1.1 billion) of revenue derived from physical music sales across the United States according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) 2020 Year-End Music Industry Revenue Report.[11][12][13][14][15]


The 2020s saw the continued impact of streaming on the record industry, a trend that began in the 2010s. Platforms like Spotify played a central role in shaping music trends, driving the success of both mainstream and emerging genres. Social media, particularly TikTok, further amplified music with viral trends, while popular genres like hip hop, r&b, pop, country, edm, latin music, k-pop, and afrobeats dominated the Billboard Hot 100 charts.[16][17][18] At the same time, underground genres like hyperpop, plugg, jersey club, phonk, rage and indie music thrived in niche communities.[19][20][21][22][23]
British rock magazine Kerrang! wrote that Olivia Rodrigo's "Good 4 U" (2021) led the commercial comeback of rock music in 2020–2021, noting how it is the first rock song since Evanescence's "Bring Me to Life" (2003) to spend four or more weeks atop the UK Singles chart, alongside chart success of other rock-adjacent artists, such as Willow Smith, Machine Gun Kelly, Måneskin, and Miley Cyrus.[24] Slate proclaimed that Rodrigo "might be the dying genre's best hope", pinpointing that "Good 4 U" is the "most up-the-middle rock song to top the [U.S.] Hot 100 in a decade or more".[25]

Media outlets and fans online observed a music trend called "Sad Girl Autumn" or "Sad Girl Fall" in the early 2020s, which refers to the release of melancholic and introspective music by female artists during autumn, such as Swift's Red (Taylor's Version), Adele's 30, Clairo's Sling, Phoebe Bridgers' Punisher, and Mitski's Laurel Hell; it is a counterpart to "Hot Girl Summer", a catchphrase coined by American rapper Megan Thee Stallion with her 2019 song of the same name.[26]

The drive for nostalgia and the desire to return to pre-pandemic life significantly influenced the shift toward older music, particularly in 2022. Data from 2021 and 2022 showed that 70% of music demand was for songs from the past, a trend that continued to grow each year.[27][28] The top 200 most popular songs accounted for only 5% of total streams, with that percentage halving over the previous three years. In 2022, older musicians like Bob Dylan, Stevie Nicks, and Bruce Springsteen sold their music rights for hundreds of millions of dollars, capitalizing on this nostalgia-driven demand.[29][30][31][32] While these iconic names had long enjoyed popularity, research indicated that the vast majority of new downloads in 2022 were songs at least two years old. Established artists from the previous decade, such as Taylor Swift, Drake, The Weekend, Ariana Grande, Kendrick Lamar, Bad Bunny, Harry Styles, and Justin Bieber, continued to dominate the charts, benefiting from their strong fanbases and major label support.[33][34][35][36]  During the early half of the decade, mainstream artists such as Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, Doja Cat, and Lil Nas X remained popular, thanks to their major label backing. In 2022, fans of indie and alternative music embraced a critical reappraisal of shoegaze. This revival, driven by online music communities, also spurred a renewed interest in music from the 1980s and 1990s. The trend reflects a broader cultural shift during the pandemic era, where listeners turned to older music.[27][28][37][38][39]

In the 2020s, Christmas music not only dominated the Billboard charts every December, but it also consistently took over the Top 10, year after year, thanks to streaming. These chart-topping hits were mostly "legacy songs"—timeless holiday classics that had been around for decades. A prime example is Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You," which repeatedly reached No. 1 and remained in the Top 10 throughout the decade.[40][41][42] Streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music helped these songs surge in popularity every holiday season, with algorithms favoring nostalgic tracks. The rise of streaming changed how people consumed music, allowing Christmas classics like Carey's hit, Bing Crosby's "White Christmas," and Wham!'s "Last Christmas" to not only chart but dominate the Billboard Top 10 for several years in a row. This shift solidified the presence of Christmas music at the forefront of the holiday season in the 2020s.[43][44]

In 2023, the music industry recorded its highest revenue of all time, with over $8.4 billion in the first half of 2023. The RIAA reported that the number of people with streaming subscriptions had more than doubled since 2019.[45] The Eras Tour, Taylor Swift's sixth headlining concert tour, became a cultural and economic phenomenon as well.[46][47][48][49]

Around 2024, AI-generated music created with tools like Udio or Suno became sophisticated and popularized.[50][51][52][53]

On July 5, 2022, American music magazine Billboard published an article listing "The 25 Musical Moments That Defined the First Quarter of the 2020s" in chronological order.[54] They are:

At the beginning of the 2020s, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Olivia Rodrigo, Harry Styles, Bruno Mars, Doja Cat, The Weeknd, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, and Lil Nas X emerged as some of the top-selling pop contemporary acts.[55][56][57] In the early years of the decade, several music executives and journalists projected Adele's album 30 to sell over a million copies in its opening week in the US.[58] However, when the album sold 692,000 copies instead, The New York Times questioned, "If Adele couldn't sell more than a million albums in a single week, could any artist?" In October 2022, Taylor Swift's Midnights debuted with over 1.1 million pure album sales, leading Rolling Stone to declare that Swift had "once again moved the goalposts regarding what the music industry can see as possible from a major pop star."[59][60][61]

Alongside these major stars, artists like Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Charli XCX, and others also gained popularity during this time, marking their own rise in the music scene. Although they were not as commercially dominant, they became increasingly influential within pop music culture.,

This period in pop music marked a time of remarkable success, with albums like Midnights, Sour, After Hours, Future Nostalgia, and Renaissance achieving widespread success, with Midnights standing out for its extraordinary, cross-format success—something not seen since the 1990s.

Olivia Rodrigo is widely considered the biggest breakthrough act of this decade.[62] She is regularly praised for her revival of pop-punk, along with her diaristic songwriting that is especially relatable to younger generations.[63] Released to instant critical and commercial acclaim, her debut album, Sour spent multiple weeks atop the Billboard 200 chart in 2021.[64] Rodrigo's singles "Drivers License" and "Good 4 U"  became commercially successful, with both topping the Billboard Hot 100 in their debut weeks.[65] Rodrigo went on to win Best Pop Solo Performance for "Drivers License", and Best Pop Vocal Album for Sour at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. The momentum she received the year prior also awarded her with Best New Artist at the ceremony.[66] Rodrigo released her sophomore studio album, Guts, to instant acclaim. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and the lead single to the album, "Vampire", spent multiple weeks atop the Hot 100 chart.[67][68] She ventured on the Sour Tour and the Guts World Tour, with the latter becoming one of the highest-grossing arena tours of 2024.[69]

Sabrina Carpenter had a massive breakthrough in pop music in 2024.[70] Following the success of her fifth studio album, Emails I Can't Send in 2022, Carpenter began to gain momentum with pop hits like "Nonsense" and "Feather".[71] In 2024, Carpenter released her sixth studio album, Short n' Sweet to massive critical and commercial acclaim, with the album debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart.[72] The album contained hits "Espresso", "Please Please Please", and "Taste", with all three songs peaking in the top three of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[73] In this decade, Carpenter embarked on the Emails I Can't Send Tour, as well as the Short n' Sweet Tour, with the latter being her first arena tour.[74] Carpenter went on to win Best Pop Solo Performance for "Espresso", and Best Pop Vocal Album for Short n' Sweet at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards.[75]

Chappell Roan reached newfound success in 2024 following the success of her single "Good Luck, Babe!".[76] Her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess was met with critical and commercial acclaim after many of its tracks went viral, including "Pink Pony Club", "Red Wine Supernova", and "Hot to Go!", with the latter having a viral crowd-friendly dance associated with it.[77] Her success was assisted by her notorious Coachella and Lollapalooza sets, with the latter performance becoming the most attended set in the festival's history.[78] Roan also opened for Olivia Rodrigo's Guts World Tour earlier in the year.[79] Her music resonates most with queer people due to her relatable lyricism regarding sapphic relationships and the tribulations that come with growing up in rural America.[80] Roan was awarded Best New Artist at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards.[81]

Tate McRae released her debut album I Used to Think I Could Fly in 2022 to acclaim.[82] In 2023, McRae released her single, "Greedy" to instant commercial success, with the song peaking at number three on the Billboard Hot 100.[83] Her second studio album, Think Later was released later that year to critical commercial acclaim.[84] McRae is praised for her choreography, and is often compared to Britney Spears when performing live.[85]

Gracie Abrams released her first two albums, Good Riddance and The Secret of Us, in 2023 and 2024, respectively. After opening for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, Abrams' songs "I Love You, I'm Sorry" and "That's So True" became commercially successful, with the latter reaching the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[86]

Miley Cyrus' seventh studio album, Plastic Hearts, was credited as a front-runner to the resurgence of pop-rock music, especially that of the 1970s-1980s.[87] Critics claimed her transition from pop music to rock brought forth a nostalgic feel, one that will seemingly become a trend this decade.[88] Her eighth studio album, Endless Summer Vacation, was preceded by the number one single, "Flowers", which was met with instant commercial success, becoming the fastest song to reach 100 million streams on Spotify—within a week.[89] At the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, Cyrus was awarded with Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for "Flowers", marking her first wins at the ceremony.[90] Cyrus won Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards for her collaboration with Beyoncé, "II Most Wanted".[91]

Billie Eilish released her second studio album, Happier Than Ever, to critical acclaim in 2021. The follow-up to her 2019 commercial breakthrough, When We all Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, Happier Than Ever was received extremely well by critics for its inclusion of stadium rock hits, such as "Happier Than Ever", and more intimate ballads, such as "Male Fantasy".[92] The album went on to be nominated for Album of the Year, as well as Best Pop Vocal Album at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. In 2023, Eilish was featured on the Barbie movie soundtrack, with her song "What Was I Made For?". The song became an instant success, and allowed Eilish to win her second Academy Award for Best Original Song.[93] In 2024, Eilish released her third studio album to instant critical and commercial acclaim, titled Hit Me Hard and Soft. The album featured hits such as "Birds of a Feather" and "Lunch", with both peaking in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[94] This decade, Eilish ventured on Happier Than Ever, The World Tour and Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour. The former allowed Eilish to become the youngest touring artist to gross over 100 million a single tour.[95]

Ariana Grande found continued success in the 2020s with her six and seventh studio albums, titled Positions and Eternal Sunshine, respectively. Both reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart for multiple weeks each.[96][97] Positions uses heavy 1990s R&B and pop elements, crediting samples from popular artists from that decade, such as Aaliyah.[98] This album spawned the hits "Positions" and "34+35", with the former topping the Hot 100 chart.[99] Eternal Sunshine gave Grande two more number one hits, with "Yes, And?", and the critically acclaimed "We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)"[100] In 2024, Grande also starred as Glinda in Wicked, her biggest role to date.[101]

Lady Gaga released her sixth studio album, Chromatica, to instant acclaim in 2020.[102] The album spawned number one single "Rain on Me" with Ariana Grande,[103] as well as "Stupid Love", which peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100.[104] At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, "Rain on Me" won Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.[105] In 2021, Gaga released her second and final collaborative album with Tony Bennett, Love for Sale, which was his last album before his death in 2023.[106][107] Gaga collaborated with Bruno Mars on number one single "Die with a Smile" in 2024,[108] which won them Best Pop/Duo Group Performance at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards.[109]

Dua Lipa became a force in pop music after the success of her second studio album, Future Nostalgia.[110] The album spawned massive hits, such as "Don't Start Now" and "Levitating", with both peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[111] The album went on to win Best Pop Vocal Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.[112] In 2023, Lipa was featured on the Barbie movie soundtrack, with her hit "Dance the Night", peaking at number six on the Hot 100 chart.[113] In 2024, Lipa released her third studio album, Radical Optimism to acclaim, with the album garnering her highest sales week ever on the Billboard 200 chart.[114] This decade, Lipa ventured on the Future Nostalgia Tour, her first arena tour, and her Radical Optimism Tour.[115][116]

Harry Styles garnered his first Billboard Hot 100 number one hit in 2020, "Watermelon Sugar", after the success of his 2019 album, Fine Line.[117] He went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards for the song.[118] In 2022, his third studio album, Harry's House, was released to instant acclaim, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart with over half a million sales.[119] The album spawned the singles "As It Was" and "Late Night Talking", with the former remaining at number-one for 15 non-consecutive weeks on the Hot 100.[120] Harry's House went on to win Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards.[121] From 2021 to 2023, Styles embarked on the Love On Tour, which would become one of the highest-grossing concert tours of all time, peaking at number four.[122]

The 2020s in music have been heavily influenced by a resurgence of musical elements brought to life in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.[123][124]

Selena Gomez released her first Spanish-language project, Revelación, in March 2021. It incorporated urbano influences.[135]

The soundtrack of Encanto, Disney's 2021 animated fantasy film, written and produced by American playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda, was a viral phenomenon, enjoying widespread popularity on the internet. It has spent multiple weeks atop the Billboard 200 chart. Far Out called the phenomenon "Encanto-mania".[136] The TikTok videos tagged with the hashtag "#encanto" have received more than 11.5 billion views in total, as of January 23, 2022.[137][138] The most popular song of the soundtrack was "We Don't Talk About Bruno", a salsa tune which experienced widespread commercial success in 2022.[139] "Dos Oruguitas" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 94th Academy Awards.[140]

On September 29, 2022, Aguilera performed "La Reina" at the 2022 Billboard Latin Music Awards and received the Billboard Spirit of Hope Award.[141] La Luz, the third and final EP from Christina Aguilera, was released that same day and featured a spoken intro by Aguilera and "No Es Que Te Extrañe".[142][143]

Even though hip hop/rap music saw a subtle decline in streaming popularity, established artists such as Drake, Tyler The Creator, Kanye West, and Kendrick Lamar maintained their presence with successful album rollouts that garnered significant Billboard chart success throughout 2020–2024.[144][145][146][147] Rappers such as Drake, Metro Boomin, Post Malone, J Cole, Lil Uzi Vert, Travis Scott, Lil Durk, JID, NLE Choppa, Chris Brown, Lil Baby, 21 Savage,  Gunna, Rod Wave, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Future, and Playboi Carti dominated mainstream hip hop discussions.[148] In 2024, Kendrick Lamar's song "Not Like Us" had a notable impact on the Billboard charts. It entered the Billboard Hot 100 and achieved a high ranking, reflecting its commercial success. The track also performed well on various genre-specific charts, such as Billboard's Hip-Hop/R&B Songs chart. Its strong debut and sustained presence on the charts highlighted its popularity and resonance with listeners during that period.[149][150][151] Additionally, Kendrick Lamar achieved six number-one hits in 2024.[152]

Michigan rap, particularly from Detroit, had a significant influence on hip-hop in the 2020s. Detroit's style, which combined elements of trap and gangsta rap, played a role in shaping both underground and mainstream rap. Artists such as Tee Grizzley, Sada Baby, Babyface Ray, Veeze, Polo G, Icewear Vezzo, Babytron, and 42 Dugg blended street stories with trap-influenced beats, creating a unique sound that resonated across the U.S. Many of these artists appeared on the Billboard Hip-Hop charts, which helped establish Michigan's presence in national hip-hop.

Late in the 2010s and early 2020s, a generation of artists emerged with party rap music that emphasizes feminism and queer empowerment. Artists such as Megan Thee Stallion, Doechii, Cardi B, Doja Cat, BIA, City Girls, Baby Tate, Saweetie, GloRilla, Sexxy Red, Flo Mili, Lil Nas X, Latto, Rico Nasty, and Ice Spice became prominent hip hop artists. Female rappers achieved widespread popularity and helped create the market for women in the predominantly male mainstream hip-hop genre thanks to their openly sexual lyrics and danceable instrumentation.

Artists such as JPEGMafia, Clipping, Danny Brown, Run the Jewels, Moor Mother, Jungle Pussy and Genesis Owusu dominated the industrial hip hop scene in the early 2020s. Visions of Bodies Being Burned, the fourth studio album by American hip hop group Clipping, was released on October 23, 2020, through Sub Pop and received positive reviews from music critics.[153][154]

The feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar emerged as a major mainstream hip hop event during the mid-2020s, influencing multiple facets of American hip hop culture throughout the rest of the decade. Lamar's diss tracks, particularly "Not Like Us," released in 2024, directly challenged Drake's position in the genre.[155][156] This came amid the resurfacing of allegations against Drake, including claims of grooming underage fans, which added complexity to the public narrative. "Not Like Us" amplified the scrutiny surrounding Drake, affecting his public image.[157] In 2024, the rivalry played a significant role in shaping the Billboard Hip Hop charts, with Lamar dominating the top spots.[158][159] Drake's "Push Ups", "Like That" and Lamar's "Meet the Grahams" alongside "Euphoria" performed well commercially.[160][161] As the feud unfolded, the mainstream hip hop community largely sided with Lamar, viewing him as the more authentic and socially conscious artist. Many fans and industry figures rallied behind Lamar's stance, praising his lyricism and political awareness. In contrast, Drake faced growing disdain due to not only the resurfacing allegations but also the "culture vulture" accusations. Critics accused Drake of appropriating hip hop culture for commercial gain, borrowing from various styles and trends without fully contributing to the culture's roots.[162] This perception, combined with the ongoing allegations, further soured his relationship with much of the American hip hop community. The media played a significant role in amplifying this division, often framing Lamar as the voice of the culture and questioning Drake's authenticity. As the feud between Drake and Lamar grew, things became more heated when Drake filed a court petition against his and Lamar's record label, Universal Music Group(UMG), in late 2024. Drake accused the label of artificially inflating Lamar's streaming numbers on Spotify, claiming this made the charts unfair and hurt his position in the music industry.[163][164][165] At the 67th Grammy Awards, Kendrick Lamar won the Record of the Year and Song of the Year award for Not Like Us.[166][167][168] The song "Not Like Us" saw another resurgence following Kendrick Lamar's explosive halftime performance with SZA, where he performed several diss tracks aimed at Drake, including the fan-favorite.[169][170][171]

Megan Thee Stallion had two number one hits in the early half of the decade, including her collaboration with Cardi B titled "WAP"[172][173] and her hit single "Savage". She released her debut album, Good News, to acclaim.[174] At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, Megan was awarded with Best New Artist, and her collaboration with Beyonce on "Savage" won both Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.[175] In 2022 and 2024, Megan released her albums Traumazine and Megan, respectively. In 2024, her single, "Hiss", debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[176]

Doja Cat quickly became one of the best-selling artists of the decade, with her breakthrough in late 2019.[177] Her first number-one single, "Say So", aided this process, as it brought the public's attention to her work.[178] In early 2021, Doja released the lead single "Kiss Me More" to her third studio album, Planet Her. The song received instant acclaim, peaking at number three on the Billboard Hot 100.[179] After the release of Planet Her, Doja secured two more top-ten hits, with "Need to Know" and "Woman", peaking at number eight and seven, respectively.[180] Planet Her became one of the best-selling albums of the decade, spending 26 weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 chart.[181] Her fourth studio album, Scarlet, debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart, and was preceded by the number-one single, "Paint the Town Red".[182]

Doechii reached newfound success in 2024 after the release of her critically acclaimed mixtape Alligator Bites Never Heal.[183] The mixtape spawned multiple viral hits, such as "Nissan Altima" and "Denial is a River".[184]  At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, Doechii became the third woman to ever win Best Rap Album, doing so for Alligator Bites Never Heal.[185]

Ice Spice reached popularity with the release of her debut EP, Like...?, launching her into commercial success. She was featured on PinkPantheress' "Boy's a Liar Pt. 2", giving both artists their first top ten hit.[186] Spice's song, "Princess Diana" reached the top ten after a remix with Nicki Minaj was released.[187] Taylor Swift released a remix with Spice on her song "Karma", which resulted in a peak of number two on the Hot 100 chart.[188] Spice and Minaj collaborated once again for the Barbie soundtrack with their single "Barbie World", which samples "Barbie Girl" by Aqua—the song also charted within the top ten.[189] Spice was nominated for Best New Artist at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards.[190]

Rage rap, which emerged in the late 2010s and continued into the 2020s, represented a significant shift in the evolution of hip-hop, characterized by high-energy performances and intense, aggressive soundscapes. This subgenre relied on distorted beats, fast tempos, and emotionally charged lyrics to create an atmosphere of chaos and raw aggression. The genre's intensity was reflected in both the production and vocal delivery, with artists pushing boundaries in rhythm, tone, and overall sound.[191][192]

The development of rage rap was influenced by a blend of underground hip-hop movements, including cloud rap, plugg music, experimental hip-hop, and southern hip-hop, all of which helped shape its unique sonic characteristics. Playboi Carti was a pivotal figure in the rise of rage rap. His 2020 album Whole Lotta Red encapsulated the genre's essence with its high-energy beats and abrasive vocals. Carti's influence extended beyond his music as he became a leader within the Opium label, which played a significant role in the genre's growth. By supporting artists like Destroy Lonely and Ken Carson, Carti helped maintain the genre's momentum.[193] The Opium label itself became a key institution for rage rap, with its distinct "Opium look" reflecting the experimental nature of the music.

Other artists, such as Yeat, Summrs, Nettspend, SoFaygo, 2hollis, OsamaSon, Cochise, TyFontaine, Lancey Foux, and KanKan, also played important roles in defining and diversifying rage rap.[194][195] While these artists brought their own influences to the genre, they maintained its core principles of intensity, aggression, and chaotic energy, helping rage rap gain wider recognition, particularly in underground hip-hop circles.[196][197]

In 2020, TikTok popularized the hip hop style drift phonk—a genre that was generally explored by music producers in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.[198] In May 2021, following the rise in popularity of the genre Spotify released an official curated phonk playlist.[citation needed]

Musicians such as The Weekend, SZA, Bruno Mars, H.E.R., Bryson Tiller, Muni Long, Summer Walker, Jhené Aiko, Silk Sonic, Victoria Monét, Khalid, Daniel Caesar, PinkPantheress, Miguel and Chris Brown dominated the 2023 R&B Billboard charts.[199][200]

SZA released her second studio album, SOS, which became her first number one on the Billboard 200,[201] and spent twelve weeks atop the chart—the most weeks of any female R&B artist since 1986, with Whitney Houston's self-titled album.[202] All of its 23 tracks charted on the Hot 100, becoming the second artist after Swift to chart 20 songs in a single week.[203] One of its singles, "Kill Bill",[204] was a major commercial success, peaking at number one on the Hot 100 chart, becoming her first song to do so.[205] Another single, "Snooze", reached a new peak of number two on the chart almost ten months after its release.[206] SZA was the recipient of three Grammy awards at the 66th Annual event, including Best Progressive R&B Album for SOS, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for "Ghost in the Machine" with Phoebe Bridgers, and Best R&B Song for "Snooze".[207] SZA embarked on her first arena tour, the SOS Tour, in 2023.[208] In 2024, SZA released Lana, a reissue of her sophomore album, SOS.[209] The album was preceded by the single "Saturn", which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[210] At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, SZA won Best R&B Song for "Saturn".[211]

Steve Lacy earned his first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100 with "Bad Habit".[212]
