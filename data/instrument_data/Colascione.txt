From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Long-necked lute
Not to be confused with Calichon.
ColascioneColascione (right)String instrumentOther namesColachonClassification
PluckedDevelopedItaly, Renaissance
The colascione (or calascione, Italian: [kolaʃˈʃoːne], French: colachon [kɔlaʃɔ̃], also sometimes known as liuto della giraffa meaning giraffe-lute, a reference to its long neck) is a plucked string instrument from the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods,[1][2][3] with a lute-like resonant body and a very long neck. It was mainly used in southern Italy. It has two or three strings tuned in fifths.
Noteworthy are the great similarities of the colascione with instruments such as the dutar or the saz. Nevertheless, there are important differences, such as the bridge being on the top of the body.

Colascioncino[edit]
A smaller version of the instrument existed, called the colascioncino, with string length 50–60 centimeters.[4]  The string length for the colascione was 100–130 centimeters.[4] Domenico Colla toured Europe with his brother in the 1760s, playing both colascione and colascioncino.
In the literature of colascione, it is often confused with calichon, a bass version of the mandora.
