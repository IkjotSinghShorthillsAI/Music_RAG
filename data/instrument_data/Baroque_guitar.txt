The Baroque guitar (c. 1600–1750) is a string instrument with five courses of gut strings and moveable gut frets. The first (highest pitched) course sometimes used only a single string.[1]


History[edit]
The Baroque guitar replaced the lute as the most common instrument found when one was at home.[2][3] The earliest attestation of a five-stringed guitar comes from the mid-sixteenth-century Spanish book Declaracion de Instrumentos Musicales by Juan Bermudo, published in 1555.[4] The first treatise published for the Baroque guitar was Guitarra Española de cinco ordenes (The Five-course Spanish Guitar), c. 1590, by Juan Carlos Amat.[5][6]
The baroque guitar in contemporary ensembles took on the role of a basso continuo instrument and players would be expected to improvise a chordal accompaniment. Several scholars have assumed that the guitar was used together with another basso continuo instrument playing the bass line.[7] However, there are good reasons to suppose that the guitar was used as an independent instrument for accompaniment in many situations.[8] Intimately tied to the development of the Baroque guitar is the alfabeto system of notation.

Tuning[edit]
Three different ways of tuning the guitar are well documented in seventeenth-century sources as set out in the following table.  This includes the names of composers who are associated with each method. Very few sources seem to clearly indicate that one method of stringing rather than another should be used and it is often argued that it may have been up to the player to decide what was appropriate. The issue is highly contentious and different theories have been put forward.[9][10][11]
At first, commonly used tuning included courses in octaves, called a 'bordón' by the Spanish and a 'bourdon' by the French. In the end of the eighteenth century the south-French and Italians introduced guitars with five single strings, first by simply taking off the doubles (so called 'French guitar' — 'Chitarra Francese').[12][13]
A very brief list of composers and tunings:

The guitar player (c. 1672), by Johannes Vermeer
Double guitar (1690) by Alexandre Voboam, 1690 (exhibited at Kunsthistorisches Museum)

An instrument of 1688[16]
is in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England, and
an instrument of 1700[17] is in the National Music Museum in Vermillion, South Dakota.
Nicholas Alexandre Voboam II (c. 1634/46–1692/1704). French luthier with three guitars bearing his signature (from a total of 26 attributed to the Voboam Family).[18][19] The guitars of Alexandre were held in high esteem during his lifetime and a century later were still considered desirable instruments.[20]

In the following year Juan Bermudo wrote in his Declaracion de Instrumentos Musicales: 'We have seen a guitar in Spain with five courses of strings.' Bermudo later mentions in the same book that 'Guitars usually have four strings,' which implies that the five-course guitar was of comparatively recent origin, and still something of an oddity."

^ Evans, Guitars (1977), p. 24: "We know from literary sources that the five course guitar was immensely popular in Spain in the early seventeenth century and was also widely played in France and Italy....Yet almost all the surviving guitars were built in Italy....This apparent disparity between the documentary and instrumental evidence can be explained by the fact that, in general, only the more expensively made guitars have been kept as collectors' pieces. During the early seventeenth century the guitar was an instrument of the people of Spain, but was widely played by the Italian aristocracy."
